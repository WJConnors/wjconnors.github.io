        BlitzBox is a cross-platform and cross-play multiplayer arena shooter built with a team of 8 people. 
		The game is built around a gravity mechanic allowing for each player to rotate the direction of their own gravity at any moment changing their position in the cube level.		
		In this project I was the head of AI and single player and these are my contributions:
        <ul>
          <li>Generating and exporting navmesh data from Unity for all sides of the cube</li>
		  <li>Importing navmeshes into the project and modifying them to work with our framework</li>
		  <li>Creating a pathfinding algorithm that works on all sides of the cube level</li>
		  <li>Creating the games AI and handling their behaviour through state machines to allow for:</li>
		  <ul>
			<li>The AI to switch between default behaviour and attacking behaviour when the player is nearby</li>
			<li>The AI to react to and pathfind to the player</li>
			<li>The AI to attack the player when appropriate</li>
			<li>The AI to handle different states and make decisions when appropriate considering states such as the reload timer</li>
		  </ul>
		  <li>Designed and created the single player game mode including the following:</li>
		  <ul>
			<li>A wave based system where the player must defeat a certain number of AI to continue</li>
			<li>The AI progressively gets harder as the game continues by getting more aggressive and more dangerous</li>
			<li>Creating a scoring system and handling game ending to be functional with the game's wider menu loop</li>
		  </ul>
        </ul>

        This project is built to demonstrate advanced graphics techniques created with OpenGL and shaders. 
        It contains multiple scenes which can be switched between that each demonstrate different effects.
        These are some of the effects and technical details created for the project:
        <ul>
          <li>Generated landscapes with multiple blended textures</li>
          <li>Standard lighting techniques using ambient, diffuse, and specular components</li>
          <li>Skybox textures used in combination with environment mapping to show water reflections</li>
          <li>Loading and animating meshes with the appropriate textures</li>
          <li>Deferred rendering and advanced buffers to allow for:
            <ul>
              <li>A post-processing blur effect</li>
              <li>Dynamically rendering up to 256 moving light sources</li>
              <li>A split-screen effect to show both scenes simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

    This university project demonstrates the use of advanced C++ features to create an optimized simulation for Conway's Game of Life. 
    It can accurately run simulations on varying board sizes and search for specific patterns, including spaceships. 
    This codebase has been built from scratch using object-orientation and utilizes many C++ features including operator overloading, templates, threading, and interfaces.
