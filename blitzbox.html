            BlitzBox is a cross-platform and cross-play multiplayer arena shooter built with a team of 8 people using an OpenGL framework. 
            The game is built around a gravity mechanic allowing for each player to rotate the direction of their own gravity at any moment changing their position in the cube level.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        
        <p>
            For this project, I was the head of AI and the single player game mode so built the full single player experience for the game. 
            Below are some code snippets and screenshots from the project.
        </p>

        <h3>AI and Pathfinding</h3>

        <p>
            The first step was using a script to extract the navmesh data from Unity. Using the NavMesh Component rather than the default Unity 
            generated NavMesh allowed me to export the cube correctly despite the navigation surface not being on top. I then imported this into 
            the framework we were using into a NavMesh class.
        </p>

        <div class="image-gallery">
            <img src="images/bbnmcode.png" alt="BlitzBox Screenshot 1" class="gallery-image">
            <img src="images/bbnmss.png" alt="BlitzBox Screenshot 2" class="gallery-image">
        </div>

        <p>
            With the imported NavMeshes for each side of the cube, I used the A* algorithm for my pathfinding. The main issue I encountered 
            is that, as seen in the screenshot below, Unity's navmesh data smooths over height to create as few triangls as possible 
            resulting in pathfinding points that are not on the ground. To solve this, I created an adjust function which will figure out 
            any differences between the height from the path and the ground beneath the AI.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            The AI itself had its behaviour defined by a state machine which took into account primarily the distance from the player 
            and the stats of the AI such as how long it can shoot for before overheating. Below is a code snippet from the creation of the state machine.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img 
              src="images/bbsmcode.png" 
              alt="Screenshot of the state machine code" 
              class="game-thumbnail"
            />
          </div>

        <h3>Single Player Game Mode</h3>

        <p>
            For the game's single player mode, I focused on creating a quick game mode that ramped up in difficulty quickly. 
            I made a game controller class which handled the overall structure and logic of the mode. 
            The player earned points by killing enemies quickly and the level would transition after killing a set amount. 
            Each new level would increase the number of AI spawned and modify their stats to make them stronger.
        </p>
