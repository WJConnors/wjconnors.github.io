        <p>
            Created in 2 days for the NCL Gameathon Jam 2025 and built in Godot, Arcade Survival is a short arcade game where you have 60 seconds 
            to score as many points as possible. You do this by switching between a variety of arcade style games to build up your multiplier and then 
            playing the individual games to score as many points as possible.<br>
            There were 2 main goals of this project. The first was to gain experience using Godot. It is an extremely useful engine due to its small footprint 
            allowing me to use it on systems which can't run larger engines and the and node system which is very powerful for making prototypes quickly and 
            iterating upon them to improve the project. The small timescale of the jam also allowed me to think very carefully about ensuring my project has appropriate 
            scope and what my minimum viable product would look like. These 2 constraints ensured a fast paced project that I was able to learn a lot from.

        <p>
            Godot's unique and versatile node system was extremely useful for this project and allows you extremely easy access to data spread around different 
            scenes in a project. This was especially useful for this project as I created multiple scenes for each individual game running inside a 
            viewport in the main scene. Being able to easily use nodes in this way made creating a well structured project very easy which is important 
            for the fast paced iteration required for such a short game jam.
