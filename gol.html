            The purpose of this project was to create a highly optimised solution for a combinatorial problem, specifically Conway's Game of Life. 
            The goal was not just to be able to simulate the game, but to be able to run experiments to find optimal starting board positions that 
            would lead to different patterns ranging from still lifes to spaceships. This required writing highly efficient code that was capable of running 
            experiments while checking for patterns very quickly.

        <p>
            The most important aspect of ensuring this code ran quickly was allowing it to be multithreaded. I approached this by having each thread individually 
            run their own simulations until the end condition for the experiment has been met. This involved using mutexes to carefully lock and unlock any 
            shared memory being used by the threads.

          <p>
            After each step of a simulation was run, it would check for any of the patterns that were being looked for. 
            The patterns were stored in their own namespace and were passed into a generic function that was used to check for each one. 
            In the case of a pattern with multiple steps, the board would store the location of the pattern on the previous step to more efficiently search for 
            the next step in the pattern.
