        Shot in the Dark is a three person Unreal Engine project made in a week for the Newcastle University Game Development Society Winter Jam 2025. 
        It is a short survival horror game where you explore a mine with a torch that has a limited battery. 
        There is a monster hunting you as you explore and the goal of the game is to collect weapon parts to eventually defeat the monster while ensuring your torch battery does not run out.<br>
        I made the following contributions to the project:
        <ul>
          <li>Creating the player character and their movement</li>
          <li>Creating the torch and the battery pickups</li>
          <li>Building and programming the UI</li>
          <li>Implementing the game's framework surrounding the gameplay</li>
          <li>Designing and implementing the game's objectives as well as the win and lose conditions</li>
          <li>Adding the game's sound effects</li>
        </ul>

        This project is built to demonstrate advanced graphics techniques created with OpenGL and shaders. 
        It contains multiple scenes which can be switched between that each demonstrate different effects.
        These are some of the effects and technical details created for the project:
        <ul>
          <li>Generated landscapes with multiple blended textures</li>
          <li>Standard lighting techniques using ambient, diffuse, and specular components</li>
          <li>Skybox textures used in combination with environment mapping to show water reflections</li>
          <li>Loading and animating meshes with the appropriate textures</li>
          <li>Deferred rendering and advanced buffers to allow for:
            <ul>
              <li>A post-processing blur effect</li>
              <li>Dynamically rendering up to 256 moving light sources</li>
              <li>A split-screen effect to show both scenes simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        This university project demonstrates the use of advanced C++ features to create an optimized simulation for Conway's Game of Life. 
        It can accurately run simulations on varying board sizes and search for specific patterns, including spaceships. 
        This codebase has been built from scratch using object-orientation and utilizes many C++ features including operator overloading, templates, threading, and interfaces.
