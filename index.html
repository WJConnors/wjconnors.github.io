                Hello! I'm Billy Connors, a former teacher and now a Computer Game Engineering MSc student passionate about learning how to improve my technical skills and making a positive contribution to the wider world.<br>
                As a programmer, I primarily use C++ but I have experience building projects in C#, Lua, Java, Python, and Haskell.
                I'm experienced in building projects with the largest game engines, particularly Unreal and Unity, but also enjoy learning to use smaller engines and frameworks such as Godot, Pico-8, and raylib.<br>
                In addition to working on my technical skills, I take every project as an opportunity to work on my design skills. Game design has fascinated me all my life and I find the creative
                experience of creating a game to be particularly fulfilling.
                To see my work or contact me, please see below.<br>
