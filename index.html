    <p>
      Hello! I'm Billy Connors, a former teacher and now a Computer Game Engineering MSc student passionate about learning how to improve my technical skills and making a contribution to the creative medium that I love.<br>
	  As a programmer, I primarily use C++ but I have experience building projects in C#, Lua, Java, Python, and Haskell. 
	  I'm experienced in building projects with the largest game engines, particularly Unreal and Unity, but also enjoy learning to use smaller engines and frameworks such as Godot, Pico-8, and raylib.<br>
	  In addition to working on my technical skills, I take every project as an opportunity to work on my design skills. Game design has fascinated me all my life and I find the creative 
	  experience of creating a game to be particularly fulfilling.
      To see my work or contact me, please see below.<br>

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>Use the left and right arrow keys to move. When you hold down a direction, the thrusters will move you forward and to the side. Press Z and X to fire. 
		Survive for as long as you can. The border will bounce you away, use this movement to your advantage.</p>
