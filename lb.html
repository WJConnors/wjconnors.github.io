        <p>
            Last Breath is a small arcade game where you must survive for as long as you can while trapped in a gravity well surrounded by asteroids. 
            It was built in about ten hours worth of work for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.1 and can be played using the embed.
        </p>

        <h4>Controls</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>Left and right arrow keys move the ship forward and in their respective directions.</li>
		  <li><em>Be aware that your ship carries a lot of momentum from small actions.</em></li>
		  <li>Z and X fire your left and right lasers.</li>
          <li>Press enter to pause the game</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>Survive as long as you can without getting hit by asteroids and score as many points as possible.</li>
		  <li>You earn <strong>1 point</strong> for avoiding an asteroid or <strong>5 points</strong> for shooting one.</li>
		  <li>The border of the gravity well shoots you back into the middle—this can either save your ship or end it depending on how well you use it.</li>
		  <li>Navigate the menu with the <strong>up and down arrow keys</strong> and select with <strong>Z</strong>.</li>
          <li>You're only expected to last a minute or so, any more is doing very well.</li>
		</ul>

        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the project was to learn how to use Pico-8, a fantasy console which also acts as an all in one development software for itself. 
            The console uses a modified version of Lua and is built with many restrictions in mind such as an 8192 token limit, 
            extremely limited sprite and map sheets which share space, a set window size of 128x128, and a set colour pallet of 16 colours.
        </p>

            Using such a restrictive development environment was an interesting experiment that forced me to change the way I thought about developing the project. 
            When given limited tools, I had to focus carefully upon how I structured and wrote my code to keep the codebase usable. 
            I effectively recreated an object orientated structure giving each object a tab and a consistent naming scheme for functions to be called 
            from the main game loop. In doing so I had to carefully consider factors like the order of drawing sprites. 
            An example of part of the game loop and an object function is show below.

        <p>
            The most enjoyable aspect of this project was the iterative design approach and trying mechanics to find what the most fun turned 
            out to be. It was obvious from the start of this project interesting and tricky movement was the focus. I liked the idea of a 
            modular ship so thrusters controlled individually matched this idea while creating an interesting movement mechanic. The best moment of the 
            project came after implementing a bouncing mechanic into the game's border, this immediately felt good to play and came with the most 
            positive feedback from playtesters. It's an immediately fun mechanic which matched the short loop of the game by being able to save 
            or end a run depending on how the mechanic was used.
