        <p>
            Shot in the Dark is a three-person Unreal Engine project made in a week for the Newcastle University 
            Game Development Society Winter Jam 2025. 
            It is a short survival horror game where you explore a mine with a torch that has a limited battery. 
            There is a monster hunting you as you explore and the goal of the game is to collect weapon parts to eventually 
            defeat the monster while ensuring your torch battery does not run out.
            The goal of this project was to quickly gain familiarity with Unreal Engine as well as gain experience working in a team.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>

        <p>
            I made the following contributions to the project:
            <ul>
              <li>Creating the player character, their movement, and their interaction with world objects</li>
              <li>Building and programming the UI</li>
              <li>Implementing the game's framework surrounding the gameplay</li>
              <li>Designing and implementing the game's objectives as well as the win and lose conditions</li>
              <li>Adding the game's sound effects</li>
            </ul>
            Due to the time constraints and the goal of gaining familiarity with the engine, this project was built in blueprints. 
            It was interesting using such a different style of programming with unique benefits and drawbacks. 
            I enjoyed how the bespoke language allowed for quick prototyping of and iteration upon game mechanics. 
            I also learned very quickly that it requires very careful use to prevent code becoming an unreadable mess of connections.
