        Shot in the Dark is a three-person Unreal Engine project made in a week for the Newcastle University Game Development Society Winter Jam 2025. 
        It is a short survival horror game where you explore a mine with a torch that has a limited battery. 
        There is a monster hunting you as you explore and the goal of the game is to collect weapon parts to eventually defeat the monster while ensuring your torch battery does not run out.<br>
        I made the following contributions to the project:
        <ul>
          <li>Creating the player character and their movement</li>
          <li>Creating the torch and the battery pickups</li>
          <li>Building and programming the UI</li>
          <li>Implementing the game's framework surrounding the gameplay</li>
          <li>Designing and implementing the game's objectives as well as the win and lose conditions</li>
          <li>Adding the game's sound effects</li>
        </ul>

	  <p>
		  Last Breath is a small arcade game where you must survive for as long as you can while trapped in a gravity well surrounded by asteroids. 
		  It was built in about ten hours worth of work for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.1 and can be played using the above embed.
		  The goal of the project was to learn how to use Pico-8, a fantasy console which also acts as an all in one development software for itself. 
		  The console uses a modified version of Lua and is built with many restrictions in mind such as an 8192 token limit, 
		  extremely limited sprite and map sheets which share space, a set window size of 128x128, and a set colour pallet of 16 colours.<br>
		  Using such a restrictive development environment was an interesting experiment that forced me to change the way I thought about developing the project. 
		  When given limited tools, I had to focus carefully upon how I structured my code to keep the codebase usable. 
		  Now I have built one project in Pico-8, I'm extremely interested in building a more complicated game in it which will force me to think carefully 
		  about how best to manage the limited resources.
		

		<h4>Controls</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>Left and right arrow keys move the ship forward and in their respective directions.</li>
		  <li><em>Be aware that your ship carries a lot of momentum from small actions.</em></li>
		  <li>Z and X fire your left and right lasers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
		<ul>
		  <li>Survive as long as you can without getting hit by asteroids and score as many points as possible.</li>
		  <li>You earn <strong>1 point</strong> for avoiding an asteroid or <strong>5 points</strong> for shooting one.</li>
		  <li>The border of the gravity well shoots you back into the middleâ€”this can either save your ship or end it depending on how well you use it.</li>
		  <li>Navigate the menu with the <strong>up and down arrow keys</strong> and select with <strong>Z</strong>.</li>
		</ul>

    <h3>Arcade Survival</h3>

    <p>
        Created in 2 days for the NCL Gameathon Jam 2025 and built in Godot, Arcade Survival is a short arcade game where you have 60 seconds 
		to score as many points as possible. You do this by switching between a variety of arcade style games to build up your multiplier and then 
		playing the individual games to score as many points as possible.<br>
		There were 2 main goals of this project. The first was to gain experience using Godot. It is an extremely useful engine due to its small footprint 
		allowing me to use it on systems which can't run larger engines and the and node system which is very powerful for making prototypes quickly and 
		iterating upon them to improve the project. The small timescale of the jam also allowed me to think very carefully about ensuring my project has appropriate 
		scope and what my minimum viable product would look like. These 2 constraints ensured a fast paced project that I was able to learn a lot from.
